JavaScript Calculator
This project is a simple calculator built using JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations and a user-friendly interface.

Features
Display: Shows the current input and results.

Number Buttons: Buttons for numbers 0-9 to input values.

Operator Buttons: Buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clear Button (C): Clears the entire display.

Delete Button (DEL): Deletes the last character from the display.

Equals Button (=): Evaluates the expression in the display.

Keyboard Support: Users can press the 'Enter' key to calculate the result.

How It Works
The calculator is created using a factory function createCalculator() which encapsulates all the calculator's logic and returns a calculator object.

Core Functions:
start(): Initializes the calculator by setting up event listeners for button clicks and keyboard presses.

buttonToDisplay(value): Appends the value of the clicked button to the display.

clearDisplay(): Clears the display input.

delete(): Removes the last character from the display value.

calculate(): Evaluates the mathematical expression in the display using the eval() function. It includes error handling for invalid expressions.

clickButtons(): Adds an event listener to the document to handle clicks on the calculator buttons. It identifies the button's function based on its CSS class.

pressEnter(): Adds an event listener to the document to allow the user to perform the calculation by pressing the 'Enter' key.

Initialization
The script creates an instance of the calculator and calls the start() method to begin listening for user input:

JavaScript

const calculator = createCalculator();
calculator.start();







eu usei html usando uma tabela para os botoes e o display e o css para alterar o estilo tambem.

JavaScript Calculator
This project is a simple, functional calculator built using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for basic arithmetic operations.

Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the calculator's layout. A <table> is used to organize the display and buttons in a clean, grid-based format.

CSS: Styles the calculator, providing the visual appearance for the display, buttons, and overall container.

JavaScript: Powers all the calculator's functionality, including handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

Features
Display: Shows the current input and results.

Number Buttons: Buttons for numbers 0-9 to input values.

Operator Buttons: Buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clear Button (C): Clears the entire display.

Delete Button (DEL): Deletes the last character from the display.

Equals Button (=): Evaluates the expression shown in the display.

Keyboard Support: Users can press the 'Enter' key to calculate the result.

How to Use
Make sure you have all the project files (index.html, your CSS file, and main.js) in the same directory.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

The calculator will be ready to use.

JavaScript Logic (main.js)
The calculator's logic is managed by a factory function createCalculator() which encapsulates all related functions and returns a calculator object.

Core Functions:
start(): Initializes the calculator by setting up event listeners for button clicks and keyboard presses.

buttonToDisplay(value): Appends the value of the clicked button to the display.

clearDisplay(): Clears the display input.

delete(): Removes the last character from the display value.

calculate(): Evaluates the mathematical expression in the display using the eval() function. It includes error handling for invalid expressions.

clickButtons(): Adds an event listener to the document to handle clicks on the calculator buttons. It identifies each button's function based on its CSS class.

pressEnter(): Adds an event listener to the document that allows the user to perform the calculation by pressing the 'Enter' key.
